:rocket: Simple Botnet Command and Control (C&C) Server in Go.

Ive Updated This Project For Both the Server And Client 
On My New Repo : 
```[ Click For Better Varient ](https://github.com/Birdo1221/Better-Go-Cnc/edit/main/README.md)```

:white_check_mark: Getting Started


Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
You can download and install it from the official site

For Windows
```
https://go.dev/dl/
```
Or for Linux Based OS'S
```
apt install golang
yum install golang
dnf install golang
```

:wrench:   You may need to configure the files for there IP's or Port Values 

Edit Line 10-11 to change the IP to connect to and the Port for the Bot connection 

```
const (
	cncServerIP   = "127.0.0.1" // Replace with your CNC server IP
	cncServerPort = ":5000"     // Replace with your CNC server port
)
```

Edit Line 14 to change the Bot Port for the Port the Bot / Client Connects at.
```
const (
	botPort         = ":5000"   // Bot will listen on port 5000
)
```

Edit Line 218-219 for the server IP to bind to and Port for the User Login on the server
```
   cncServerIP := "127.0.0.1"
   cncServerPort := "6000"
```


To compile the C&C server and the bot server, follow these steps:

Clone this repository, Change folder dir to the main program file and using the Go compiler
```
go build main.go

go build bot.go

go run main.go
go run bot.go    
```

:gear:  Running the C&C Server

Start the C&C server on port 1338 [default port].
```
./main
```

After Start the Bot / Client  on a virtual machine or on your local machine to test it out, monitor you network to see the packet to the [ Client <--> Bot ] or [ Bot <--> Client ] , i wouldnt recommend using on public foward facing networks as it has no security implementations or anything to save you.
```
./main
```

:speech_balloon:   The C&C server will start listening for incoming connections from Clients on port 1338.
You can change via the SRC.
Login info is on a text file in this format. [Users.txt]
```
Admin:Passwd
```
Once connected to the C&C server, the administrator can send commands.

 
:bulb:   Example Commands
```
bots: Get the number of connected bots.

clear: Clear the screen of the connected bot terminals.

logout: Log out from the C&C server.
```

To connect To the cnc I would recommend using mobaxterm or putty use the ip the server is running on and the botport and then you will be a login menu for the cnc
