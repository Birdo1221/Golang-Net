To compile the C&C server and the bot server, follow these steps:

Clone this repository, Change folder dir to the main program file and using the Go compiler

```
go build main.go
go run main.go   
go build bot.go  
go run bot.go    
```

StartS the C&C server on port 1338 [default]:
```
./main

The C&C server will start listening for incoming connections from Clients on port 1338.

Login info is on a text file in this format. [Users.txt]

Username:Passwd

Edit line 10 - 11 on bot.go to change the ip / port it listens / connects to.
The bot will attempt to connect to the server at the specified IP and port.
 
Once connected to the C&C server, the administrator can send commands.
