## üìã Overview
A simple Command and Control (C&C) server implementation in Go, created for educational purposes to understand network programming and client-server architecture.

## üö¶ Prerequisites
- Go programming language installed on your system

### Installation Guide

#### Windows
Download and install Go from [official website](https://go.dev/dl/)

#### Linux
Choose your package manager:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
apt install golang

# RHEL/CentOS
yum install golang

# Fedora
dnf install golang
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Bot Configuration
Edit these values in `bot.go`:
```go
const (
    cncServerIP   = "127.0.0.1"  // Your CNC server IP
    cncServerPort = ":5000"      // Your CNC server port
)

const (
    botPort = ":5000"  // Bot listening port
)
```

### Server Configuration
Edit these values in `main.go`:
```go
cncServerIP := "127.0.0.1"    // Server binding IP
cncServerPort := "6000"       // User login port
```

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build and run the components:

```bash
# Build components
go build main.go
go build bot.go

# Run components
go run main.go
go run bot.go
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the Server
```bash
./main
```

### User Authentication
